[Greek Youvetsi With Lamb](http://realgreekrecipes.blogspot.com/2009/01/greek-youvetsi-with-lamb.html)

from @marsella

This is a popular dish in Greece and quite easy to prepare. It is usually made with lamb, but you can use other meat if you so prefer. You should be able to obtain Greek 'kritharaki' pasta (orzo) where you live, as it is exported all over the world, but if you can't find it, you can order it here - Misko Orzo (Large) - Kritharaki Metrio


## Ingredients

* 1 leg of young lamb cut into portions
* 200g Greek ‘kritharaki’ pasta (orzo)
* 1 grated onion
* 200 ml fresh tomato juice
* 100 ml slightly concentrated tomato juice
* 3 cloves
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 100 ml olive oil
* Salt and pepper to taste


## Preparation

Gently fry the lamb in the olive oil for 5 minutes.

Add the grated onion and continue frying for another 5 minutes.

Add the tomato juice and when it starts boiling, add 1½ litres of water.

Add the cinnamon stick, cloves, salt and pepper.

Cook the lamb until it is tender, by which time the water should have been reduced in quantity by nearly a half.

At this point you need to have at least 1½ litres of liquid in the pan, so add enough water to make up the difference and bring to the boil once again.

Remove the cinnamon stick and cloves and transfer to an oven dish, which you then place in a preheated oven at 200 degrees Celsius.

Once it starts to bubble, remove from the oven and add the kritharaki pasta.

Stir the pasta in well and place in the oven again.

Stir again after 5 minutes.

Leave in the oven until all the liquid has been absorbed.

Serve with grated cheese on top – ideally Greek Kefalotiri.
